    <p>I do not have a face to see,</p>
    <p>Or put inside a frame.</p>
    <p>I do not have soft cheeks to kiss,</p>
    <p>I don't yet have a name.</p>
    <p>You can't yet hold my tiny hands,</p>
    <p>Nor whisper in my ear.</p>
    <p>It's still too soon to sing a song,</p>
    <p>Or cuddle me so near.</p>
    <p>But all will change come November,</p>
    <p>That's when they say I'm due.</p>
    <p>I'm your new grandson or granddaughter,</p>
    <p>I can't wait till I meet you.</p>
    <p>All I ask between now and then,</p>
    <p>Is your patience while I grow.</p>
    <p>I promise I'll be worth the wait,</p>
    <p>Because of all the love we'll know.</p>
    <p>So what I have to give you now,</p>
    <p>is a wish to you from me.</p>
    <p>I cannot wait to be a part</p>
    <p>Of this wonderful family.</p>
    <p>Love, Baby</p>
